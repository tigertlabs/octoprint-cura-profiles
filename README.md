# Octoprint Cura Profiles

This is just a backup of my OctoPrint slicing profiles for the Velleman Vertex K8400 3D-printer in case my SD card gets corrupted. So likely not something others will find useful.

But since we're talking, these seem to work OK for the "eSun" 1.75mm PLA filament I got from HobbyKing.
